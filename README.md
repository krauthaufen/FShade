# FShade
FShade is a library for writing Shaders in F# using code-quotations. 
 
The main documentation is located at:
http://www.fshade.org/

FShade is neatly integrated into [Aardvark.Rendering](https://github.com/aardvark-platform/aardvark.rendering), where example shaders and compositions are showcased. You can find compute shaders in [Aardvark.GPGPU](https://github.com/aardvark-platform/aardvark.rendering/tree/master/src/Aardvark.GPGPU). Supplementary documentation is in [this repository's wiki](https://github.com/krauthaufen/FShade/wiki), including the Shader Debugger.
